## Research Purpose
The objective of this research is to analyze trends and patterns in global video game sales. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we seek to identify the factors that influence a video game's success, including platform, genre, release year, and sales region. This study will provide a better understanding of the industry's evolution and identify market opportunities.
## Methodology
- Data Import and Exploration:
The dataset was loaded from Kaggle, and the first rows, descriptive statistics, and data types were explored.
Null values ​​were analyzed, and an imputation strategy was implemented for missing data, replacing null values ​​in the 'Publisher' column with "Unknown."
- Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Video games with inconsistent or incomplete data were removed.
Data was filtered back to 2015, as records after that were scarce and did not add value to the analysis.
Correct formatting was ensured for the year columns and other relevant data.
Errors in release dates were identified and corrected.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Sales trends by platform, genre, and region were analyzed.
The relationship between the best-selling video games and their respective features was explored.
Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of sales across different markets and time periods.
## Conclusions
- Platform Dominance:
The top-selling video game consoles vary over the years, but the PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, and Xbox 360 stand out as some of the most successful in terms of sales volume.
